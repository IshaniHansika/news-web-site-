			<h3>Chinese nationals urged to strictly abide by Sri Lankan laws and regulations</h3>
			<p>The Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka has urged all Chinese nationals visiting Sri Lanka to abide by Sri Lankan laws and regulations. <br>Making a statement on the recent incident  in which a Chinese national was found to have allegedly entered Sri Lanka with two passports, the Embassy notified all Chinese citizens who come to Sri Lanka for business, work, study and tourism to ‘strictly abide by Sri Lankan laws and regulations’. <br> They further urged visiting Chinese nationals to respect both religious and cultural customs practiced in Sri Lanka. <br> Commenting specifically on the incident in question, the Embassy assured that investigations into the matter are underway. <br> A rather controversial matter came up when, earlier this week, a Chinese national who was set to be deported on suspicions of having used a forged passport to enter Sri Lanka was later allowed to enter the island. <br> The Chinese national in question, who allegedly entered the country with two passports, was summoned before the Department of Immigration and Emigration yesterday (22 May), to give a statement on the matter, following Public Security Minster Tiran Alles’ order that all required action be taken by the relevant authorities. <br> Speaking at a special press briefing later that evening, Alles stated that further action in this regard will be taken following consultations with the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka.

			<h3>Welfare benefits to be deposited directly into recipients’ bank accounts</h3>
			<p>In a bid to address the challenges faced by welfare beneficiaries in receiving their allowances, the Welfare Benefits Board says it has decided to implement a direct crediting system effective from July. <br> The move will ensure that beneficiaries’ bank accounts are directly credited with the relevant welfare benefits, according to Welfare Benefit Board Chairman B. Wijayaratne. <br> His remarks came during the “101 Katha” program produced by the President’s Media Division (PMD). <br> This encompasses the correction of any previous errors in social welfare benefits and the continuation of existing government assistance programs such as Samurdhi and Elderly Assistance, Wijayaratne added. <br> To further assist those without bank accounts, the Welfare Benefit Board has taken the necessary steps to facilitate the opening of bank accounts for beneficiaries who do not have one.  ,<br>Speaking on the ‘Aswesuma’ welfare benefits program, the chairman said the selection of beneficiaries is carried out through a centralized data base, ensuring that political affiliations do not influence the assistance provided. <br> The ‘Aswesuma’ welfare benefit program, initiated by the President as part of the social safety net to alleviate the ongoing economic crisis, is under the purview of Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe, with involvement from various Government agencies, including the Ministry of Finance.</p>
