			<h3>Fixtures released for ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier 2023</h3>
			<p>What this’unspecific’ intelligence was not clear. But some reports say it was actually a social media post by Wasantha Mudalige, the IUSF coordinator. It says in Sinhala: “Anthare is positioned everywhere. Why only Colombo? The entire Country should be surrounded.” On the back of that, there was an order made at a Colombo University Student’s canteen for 1,500 lunch packets, which the Police interpreted as an IUSF plan to bring in students from other universities to Colombo. However, it was later revealed that the food order had been made by organisers of an event in the Arts Department, where some 500 new students were expected to attend, some with parents. <br>After the president was alerted of the intelligence, the president’s chief of Staff, Sagala Ratnayake, held an emergency meeting with public security minister Tiran Alles. Later, Army Commander Lt. Gen. Vikum Liyanage, Major General Suresh Sallay, and Western Province SDIG Deshabandu Tennakoon were summoned to the President’s Office, where the decision was made to deploy additional security forces to aid the Police. Security was to be tightened in key protest sites and government establishments. </p>

			<p>The Mahatma Gandhi Scholarships were awarded to 300 A/L students from 25 districts across Sri Lanka by Indian High Commissioner Gopal Baglay, Education Minister Dr.Susil Premajayantha and Education State Minister A. Aravindh Kumar at a special ceremony in Education Ministry on May 18, 2023. <br>LK Rs. 2,500 per student is being provided to students on merit cum means basis to the top six students from each district every month under this Scholarship. This year, scholarships were awarded to two batches simultaneously due to COVID during 2021 - 2022. <br>Congratulating students for their achievement, the High Commissioner highlighted the importance of bilateral cooperation in the education sector for bright future of youth in both countries. Drawing parallels between Buddha and Mahatma, he said that the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi hold good even in the fast-changing world. Underlining the close cultural links between India and Sri Lanka, he called on the young students to utilise the opportunities available in India where rapid advances are taking place in education. He said that the young students of Sri Lanka would be a great source of strength for both India and Sri Lanka in future. <br>Minister Dr.Premajayantha thanked the Government of India for providing not only Mahatma Gandhi Scholarships, but also various other Scholarships and opportunities in prestigious institutions including the IITs. He said that these initiatives proved to be instrumental to the growth of Sri Lanka’s Human Resource.</p>

			<h3>Manchester City win Premier League title as Arsenal lose</h3>
			<p>Farmers in the Anuradhapura District urge the Anuradhapura District Agriculture Committee, Government Agent, Wildlife Conservation Assistant Director and Divisional Secretaries to address human-elephant conflict, which is increasing rapidly in many areas in the district. <br>The Wildlife Conservation Department sources said they lacks manpower and transport facilities to drive away wild elephants when villagers are affected, which happens every day. A 484.2 km long electric fence in the Anuradhapura District, which was proposed three years ago, was not implemented despite enough construction materials are in stores in the district, they said. <br>A spokesman of the Wildlife Conservation Department told the Daily News that Rs. 80 million has been allocated initially to complete the construction under the first phase. <br> Meanwhile, wild elephants attacked four houses in Bellankadawala in the Kebithigollewa DS Division and around 100 gunny bags of paddy in the houses were destroyed. The villagers spend nights on rooftops and in temporary bunkers in the thick jungle during wild elephants’ invasions. <br>They requested wildlife authorities to set up a sub-office in Bellankadawala since in an emergency; they have to wait until wildlife officers visit the area travelling about 80 km from Medawachchiya. <br>On May 17, a 63-year-old woman in Ihalawewa in the Thalawa DS Division died of a wild elephant attack in the morning.</p>

			<h3>Sri Lanka Rugby suspended as a member of World Rugby</h3>
			<p>Thousands of Security Forces, Police and Civil Security Department personnel who laid their supreme sacrifice for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of the nation were commemorated at the Victory Day Commemoration at the War Heroes Memorial at Battaramulla under the patronage of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday (18). <br> Sri Lanka defeated terrorism and brought peace to the country on May 19, 2009, ending a brutal war that prevailed for over three decades. A large number War Heroes laid down their lives for the Motherland and were maimed during the battle with terrorists. <br> This year marks the 14th anniversary of the victory over LTTE terrorism that lasted for three decades. A total of 28,619 War Heroes from the Army, Air Force, Navy, Police and Civil Security Department (CSD) sacrificed their lives for the freedom of the Motherland, while over twenty-seven thousand War Heroes were rendered disabled. The ceremony was a proud expression of the nation’s gratitude towards these brave individuals. <br> The ceremony began with the playing of the National Anthem, followed by a two-minute silence observed by the President, the Prime Minister and others in honour of the fallen War Heroes.</p>

			<h3>Zimbabwe’s Heath Streak seriously ill with cancer</h3>
			<p>The Department of Immigration and Emigration (DIE) under a novel programme decided to issue all passports under a new system from June 1 in order to stop people having to wait for long hours at Department premises in Battaramulla.   <br> Commissioner General of the Department Harsha Ilukpitiya told the Daily News that this decision was taken following several complaints made by people that an organised group is in the habit of extorting money from people visiting the <br>Department premises at Battaramulla promising that they would be able to get the duly completed passports during the course of the day. <br>According to various complaints received, this unscrupulous group charges between Rs.15,000 to Rs.20,000 from each person to get their fully completed genuine passport without any difficulties during the day. <br>The DIE Commissioner General further said under the new online system that would be effective from June 1, applicants will be able to receive their passports to their homes by Registered Post within three days. <br>He said what applicants should do is to first visit the authorised Divisional Secretariat in their respective areas and obtain the necessary applications to apply for the new passport. <br>It is said that only 50 Divisional Secretariats in the country have so far been given the authority to accept passport applications.</p>
