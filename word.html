			<h3>Final draft of new Electricity Act to be presented before Cabinet in June</h3>
			<p>The final draft of the new Electricity Act is due to be submitted to the Attorney General’s Department and the legal draftsman next week, for translation and certification purposes, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera said. <br> The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Reforms Committee, together with the legal and energy consultants provided by development agencies to assist the relevant reforms met at the President’s Office this morning (23 May) to discuss the final draft of the new Act and the transition programme in this regard. <br> Accordingly, the previous timeline predicted for the completion of the final draft has been amended, and thus, owing to observations made by stakeholders, the amended final draft of the Act will be presented before the Cabinet in the month of June, albeit initially scheduled for last week. <br> Chief of Staff to the President Sagala Ratnayake, members of the CEB Reforms Committee and development agency consultants were present at the meeting. <br> Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka have signed the minutes of the joint committee and affirmed the necessity of following up on the recommendations contained, in order to ensure enhancing bilateral cooperation in different fields of common interests.

			<h3>IMF Staff Concludes Visit to Sri Lanka</h3>
			<p>Farmers in the Anuradhapura District urge the Anuradhapura District Agriculture Committee, Government Agent, Wildlife Conservation Assistant Director and Divisional Secretaries to address human-elephant conflict, which is increasing rapidly in many areas in the district. <br>The Wildlife Conservation Department sources said they lacks manpower and transport facilities to drive away wild elephants when villagers are affected, which happens every day. A 484.2 km long electric fence in the Anuradhapura District, which was proposed three years ago, was not implemented despite enough construction materials are in stores in the district, they said. <br>A spokesman of the Wildlife Conservation Department told the Daily News that Rs. 80 million has been allocated initially to complete the construction under the first phase. <br> Meanwhile, wild elephants attacked four houses in Bellankadawala in the Kebithigollewa DS Division and around 100 gunny bags of paddy in the houses were destroyed. The villagers spend nights on rooftops and in temporary bunkers in the thick jungle during wild elephants’ invasions. <br>They requested wildlife authorities to set up a sub-office in Bellankadawala since in an emergency; they have to wait until wildlife officers visit the area travelling about 80 km from Medawachchiya. <br>On May 17, a 63-year-old woman in Ihalawewa in the Thalawa DS Division died of a wild elephant attack in the morning.</p>

			<h3>First international Mining and Minerals Conference</h3>
			<p>Thousands of Security Forces, Police and Civil Security Department personnel who laid their supreme sacrifice for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of the nation were commemorated at the Victory Day Commemoration at the War Heroes Memorial at Battaramulla under the patronage of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday (18). <br> Sri Lanka defeated terrorism and brought peace to the country on May 19, 2009, ending a brutal war that prevailed for over three decades. A large number War Heroes laid down their lives for the Motherland and were maimed during the battle with terrorists. <br> This year marks the 14th anniversary of the victory over LTTE terrorism that lasted for three decades. A total of 28,619 War Heroes from the Army, Air Force, Navy, Police and Civil Security Department (CSD) sacrificed their lives for the freedom of the Motherland, while over twenty-seven thousand War Heroes were rendered disabled. The ceremony was a proud expression of the nation’s gratitude towards these brave individuals. <br> The ceremony began with the playing of the National Anthem, followed by a two-minute silence observed by the President, the Prime Minister and others in honour of the fallen War Heroes.</p>

			<h3>U.S., China to hold deputy-level bilateral talks on debt – sources</h3>
			<p>The Department of Immigration and Emigration (DIE) under a novel programme decided to issue all passports under a new system from June 1 in order to stop people having to wait for long hours at Department premises in Battaramulla.   <br> Commissioner General of the Department Harsha Ilukpitiya told the Daily News that this decision was taken following several complaints made by people that an organised group is in the habit of extorting money from people visiting the <br>Department premises at Battaramulla promising that they would be able to get the duly completed passports during the course of the day. <br>According to various complaints received, this unscrupulous group charges between Rs.15,000 to Rs.20,000 from each person to get their fully completed genuine passport without any difficulties during the day. <br>The DIE Commissioner General further said under the new online system that would be effective from June 1, applicants will be able to receive their passports to their homes by Registered Post within three days. <br>He said what applicants should do is to first visit the authorised Divisional Secretariat in their respective areas and obtain the necessary applications to apply for the new passport. <br>It is said that only 50 Divisional Secretariats in the country have so far been given the authority to accept passport applications.</p>
